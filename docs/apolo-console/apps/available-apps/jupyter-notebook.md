# Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook application in Apolo Console provides an interactive environment for writing, running, and sharing code in multiple programming languages. It enables users to create dynamic documents that include live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text, making it a powerful tool for data science, research, and software development.

## Installing Jupyter Notebook

1. In the Apps section, click on Jupyter Notebook to proceed with installation.
2. Configure Resources:
* Select a *Preset* that defines the allocated compute resources (CPU, memory, GPU).

### Automatic Shutdown
The installed instance is automatically shut down after 2 hours of inactivity (if no one interacts with it and there are no running cells).
To keep the instance running, ensure that code execution is active and that the session remains interactive.

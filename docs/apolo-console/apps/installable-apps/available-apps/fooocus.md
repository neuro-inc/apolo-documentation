# Fooocus

Fooocus is a free, offline, open-source image generator designed for high-quality text-to-image creation with minimal prompt engineering or parameter tuning. It features advanced capabilities like custom inpainting and outpainting algorithms, image prompting, and prompt weighting, ensuring superior results even with simple prompts. Fooocus supports SDXL models, offers robust options for image upscaling and variation, and includes tools for negative prompts, face swapping, and textual image descriptions. Additional features like adjustable style, quality, and sampling parameters, along with multi-prompt and embedding support, make it versatile for creative applications. With a minimum GPU requirement of 4GB, it balances accessibility with powerful functionality.

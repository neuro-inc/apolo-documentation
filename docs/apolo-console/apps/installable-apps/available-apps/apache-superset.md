#### Installation and Deployment on Apolo

You can deploy Apache Superset on the Apolo platform using the **`Apache Superset`** app. Apolo automates resource allocation, persistent storage, ingress, and environment variable injection, so you can focus on model configuration.

**Highlights of the Apolo Installation Flow**:

1. **Resource Allocation**: Choose an Apolo preset (e.g. `gpu-xlarge`, `mi210x2`) that specifies CPU, memory, and GPU resources.
2. **Ingress Setup**: Enable an ingress to expose vLLMâ€™s HTTP endpoint for external access.
3. **Integration with Postgres**: You can bring Postgresql instance, for example deployed on Apolo.
4. **Configuration for an admin user**: Configure a Web access.

# Mistral

**Mistral is a high-performance and scalable family of open-weight language models developed by Mistral AI.**\
It is optimized for fast inference and supports both base and instruction-tuned variants, making it suitable for a wide range of production-grade NLP tasks such as reasoning, summarization, and chat.

**Mistral is available through the vLLM application and is designed for instant deployment, minimizing the need for manual configuration.**\
If you need to customize the deployment, use the configurable application variant. Examples of tunable parameters include `server-extra-args`, Ingress authentication, and more.

#### Key Features

* **Minimal Setup**: Automatic detection of available preset based on chosen model.
* **High Throughput Inference**: Novel GPU KV caching enables faster token generation compared to traditional implementations.
* **Multi-GPU Support**: Scales seamlessly to multiple GPUs, including AMD (MI200s, MI300s) and NVIDIA (V100/H100/A100) resource pools.
* **Easy Model Downloading**: Built-in integration with Hugging Face model repositories.
* **Lightweight & Extensible**: Minimal overhead for deployment and easy to integrate with existing MLOps or monitoring solutions.

#### Installation and Deployment on Apolo

You can deploy Mistral LLMs on the Apolo platform using the **Mistral** app. Apolo automates resource allocation, persistent storage, ingress setup, GPU detection, and environment variable injectionâ€”allowing you to focus entirely on model selection and configuration.

**Highlights of the Apolo Installation Flow**:

1. **Integration with Hugging Face**: You can pass your Hugging Face token via an environment variable to pull private models.
2. **Preset Auto-Configuration**: Preset will be chosen by default, according to HuggingFace model minimal vRAM requirements.
3. **Ingress Setup**: By default will be enabled without authentication.
4. **Autoscaling**: Apolo provides built-in support for horizontal pod autoscaling of Mistral deployments based on incoming request load. Parameters for autoscaling (min replicas - 1, max replicas - 5, 100 requests per second to start scaling)
5.  **Cache**: The caching of your model is enabled by default, the storage path is&#x20;

    ```
    storage://{cluster_name}/{org_name}/{project_name}/llm_bundles
    ```

## Apolo Deployment

| **Hugging Face Token** | **Required**. Provide a Hugging Face token if model is gated.  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**              | **Required**. Select model size from the dropdown.             |

***

### Web Console UI

Step1 - Select  [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) token

Step2 - Choose the size of your model

If Model is [gated](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-gated), please make sure that your HuggingFace token has an access to it.

Step 3 - Install and wait for the outputs, at the Outputs section of an app

### Autoscaling

If you Enable the autoscaling, the following parameters will be applied:

**Default Autoscaling Configuration:**

* **Trigger Threshold**: 100 requests per second
* **Replica Range**: Minimum 1, Maximum 5 replicas
* **Behavior**: The system monitors request volume and automatically adjusts the number of running replicas to match current demand, ensuring efficient use of GPU resources while maintaining performance.

### Usage

```python
import requests

API_URL = "<APP_HOST>/v1/chat/completions"

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
}

data = {
    "model": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1",  # Must match the model name loaded by vLLM
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant that gives concise and clear answers.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": (
                "I'm preparing a presentation for non-technical stakeholders "
                "about the benefits and limitations of using large language models in our customer support workflows. "
                "Can you help me outline the key points I should include, with clear, jargon-free explanations and practical examples?"
            ),
        },
    ]
}


if __name__ == '__main__':

    response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=data)
    response.raise_for_status()

    reply = response.text
    status_code = response.status_code
    print("Assistant:", reply)
    print("Status Code:", status_code)
```

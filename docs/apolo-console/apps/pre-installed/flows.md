# Flows

**Apolo Flow** is a powerful pipeline engine designed for MLOps workflows on the Apolo platform. It enables seamless orchestration, automation, and execution of machine learning pipelines.

### Use Cases

* Automating ML workflows, from data ingestion to model deployment.
* Running batch and live workflows for continuous training and inference.
* Managing dependencies and execution order across pipeline steps.
* Standardizing and versioning workflows for reproducibility and collaboration.

### Example Use Case

Imagine a data science team working on a fraud detection model. They can use Apolo Flow to:

1. Ingest transaction data from multiple sources.
2. Preprocess the data and extract relevant features.
3. Train and validate multiple models in parallel.
4. Deploy the best-performing model into production.

### Models of Operation

* **CLI Usage**: Provides a command-line interface for managing pipelines, configuring workflows, and executing actions.
* **Configuration Files**: Uses structured configuration files to define workflow syntax, actions, and dependencies.
* **Workflow Syntax**: Supports batch and live workflows, allowing users to define execution logic and contexts.

For detailed documentation, refer to the dedicated Apolo Flow reference guide.

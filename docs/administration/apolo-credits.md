# Apolo Credits

## Overview

Apolo supports muti-tiered billing and credits that enable our customers to easily setup a framework to monitor and control resource usage on up to individual project user level and up to tenant/org level. Each resource preset can be assigned an amount of credits per hour that this resource "spends" once used.  The billing reports are available on the level of user/project/cluster/org to detail the usage associated with it for any given period. Apolo supports consumption metering on an organization level via a billing credits system.

## **Assigning credits**

Credits are assigned to an organization by one of two methods:

1. Provisioning credits to an organization by the cluster administrator.
2. Purchasing credits via a credit card in the GUI.

## **Metering**

Metering is supported for storage and consumption of resource presets by an application or job. Consumption rate is set using credits per hour on the cluster level by cluster administrator. Credits per hour rate is set for each cluster resource ( resource preset ), application and unit of storage. Credits can be tracked using billing reports dashboards for each organization, project and user for any period of time.

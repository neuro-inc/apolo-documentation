# Deployment Process

Cluster creation can be coordinated over email or Slack. Together with the client, we define:\
\- Hardware specifications: RAM, CPU, disk, GPU\
\- Network limits: speed, segmentation\
\- Network particularities: VPN channels, etc.\
\- Storage requirements\
\- Load balancing setup\
\
Once defined, provisioning is completed quickly — whether via automated tooling or direct engineering — and initial access is provided through a secure kubeconfig bundle. Additional namespaces, configurations, and integrations with Apolo’s MLOps workflows can be performed jointly or fully managed by our team.

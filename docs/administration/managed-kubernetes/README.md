# Managed Kubernetes

### Overview

Apolo is an MLOps platform built to operate across a wide range of partner data center environments, delivering secure, production-grade AI infrastructure. Kubernetes is at the core of our orchestration layer, providing the foundation for running and scaling AI workloads.\
\
Apolo delivers production-grade Kubernetes clusters with a fully managed control plane and data plane. Depending on the data center, this can be provisioned through integrated automation or via direct engagement with our dedicated DevOps and MLOps team. In all cases, the end result meets the same operational, performance, and security standards.

# Teaching Models To Reason - Training, Fine-Tuning, and Evaluating Models with LLaMA Factory on Apolo

This tutorial will guide you through **training, fine-tuning, and evaluating models** using **LLaMA Factory on the Apolo platform**. By the end, you will be able to:

* **Deploy LLaMA Factory on Apolo**
* **Train and fine-tune models using Web UI or CLI**
* **Evaluate and test your trained models**
* **Serve the fine-tuned model via API for real-world applications**

### **Prerequisites**

Before proceeding, ensure you have: \
‚úÖ **Apolo CLI installed** (Follow the Apolo CLI[ Installation Guide](https://docs.apolo.us/index/cli/installing))\
‚úÖ [**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) **installed** for building images \
‚úÖ **An Apolo project is set up** (will use current project if no project is set)\
‚úÖ **A HuggingFace token set as a secret** You can do that by running the following command

```
apolo secret add HF_TOKEN <your_token>
```

### **1. Deploying LLaMA Factory on Apolo**

#### **Step 1: Clone the LLaMA Factory Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neuro-inc/LLaMA-Factory
cd LLaMA-Factory
```

Inside the apolo branch you will notice a  .`apolo`  folder containing a `live.yaml`. You can find more on the structure of the file below [here](https://docs.apolo.us/index/apolo-flow-reference/workflow-syntax/live-workflow-syntax).

```yaml
kind: live
title: llama_factory

defaults:
  life_span: 5d

images:
  llama_factory:
    ref: image:$[[ project.id ]]:v1
    dockerfile: $[[ flow.workspace ]]/docker/docker-cuda/Dockerfile
    context: $[[ flow.workspace ]]/

volumes:
  hf_cache:
    remote: storage:$[[ flow.project_id ]]/hf_cache
    mount: /root/.cache/huggingface
    local: hf_cache
  data:
    remote: storage:$[[ flow.project_id ]]/data
    mount: /app/data
    local: data
  output:
    remote: storage:$[[ flow.project_id ]]/output
    mount: /app/saves
    local: output

jobs:
  llama_factory_webui:
    image: ${{ images.llama_factory.ref }}
    name: llama-factory
    preset: H100X1
    http_port: "7860"
    detach: true
    browse: true
    env:
      HF_TOKEN: secret:HF_TOKEN
    volumes:
      - ${{ upload(volumes.data).ref_rw }}
      - ${{ volumes.output.ref_rw }}
      - ${{ volumes.hf_cache.ref_rw }}
    cmd: bash -c "cd /app && llamafactory-cli webui"

```

Key fields to consider when deploying LlamaFactory on Apolo:

* `preset`  In this case we have H100X1 (Requests a single NVIDIA H100 GPU.)\
  to list all available presets on your cluster you can use:

```
apolo config show
```

* `data` volume, this will upload everything you have in the data folder to the jobs `/app/data`
* `output` volume, this is where you can save your checkpoints and training artifacts, the job will write to this folder /app/saves

#### **Step 2: Build the LLaMA Factory Docker Image on Apolo**

```bash
apolo-flow build llama_factory
```

This command:

* Uses the **Dockerfile configured for CUDA** (located at `docker/docker-cuda/Dockerfile`).
* Pushes the built image to the **Apolo image registry**.

**Output Example**:

```bash
[0600] Pushing image to registry.<your_cluster_name>.org.apolo.us/apolo/<your_project_name>/llama_factory:v1 
INFO[0611] Pushed registry.<your_cluster_name>.org.apolo.us/apolo/<your_project_name>/llama_factory@sha256:6cc93e18...
INFO: Successfully built image: llama_factory:v1
```

**Note:**  If you need to work with other datasets that are not supported by default, you should add support for them by extending the `dataset_info.json`. This file allows for field mapping and format type selection. I added open-r1/OpenR1-Math-220k, a reasoning dataset that will be used to finetune a Llama 3B model to enhance its reasoning capabilities.

<pre class="language-json"><code class="lang-json"><strong>{
</strong>
"open-r1/OpenR1-Math-220k": {
      "hf_hub_url": "open-r1/OpenR1-Math-220k", 
      "formatting": "sharegpt",
      "ranking": false,
      "split": "train", // use test split if available in the dataset
      "columns": {
        "messages": "messages"  
      },
      "tags": {
        "role_tag": "role",
        "content_tag": "content",
        "user_tag": "user",
        "assistant_tag": "assistant",
        "system_tag": "system"
      }
    }
}

</code></pre>



#### **Step 3: Run the LLaMA Factory Web UI**

```bash
apolo-flow run llama_factory_webui
```

This will:

* Copy necessary datasets and configurations to Apolo storage.
* Start the **llama\_factory\_webui** job.

**Output Example**:

```bash
‚àö Job ID: job-f6522c71-1912-4775-962e-19f3c1357224
‚àö Name: llama-factory
‚àö Status: running
‚àö Http URL: https://llama-factory--0214c319f8.jobs.<your_cluster_name>.org.apolo.us
```

#### **Step 4: Access the Web UI**

**You can either use the URL above, which is part of the deployment output or wait for a new tab to open automatically with the Llama Factory Web UI, as seen below.**

üéâ **You are now ready to train and fine-tune models!**

### **2. Training & Fine-Tuning Models with LLaMA Factory**

#### **Option 1: Fine-Tuning Using the Web UI**

Once inside the Web UI:

**Step 1: Select Base Model**

* Choose a **base model** (e.g., `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, Llama-3.2-3B`).
* Specify the **model path** (Hugging Face model).

**Step 2: Choose Training Method**

* **Full** (for training all parameters).
* **LoRA** (lightweight, efficient fine-tuning).
* **Freeze (freeze certain layers, there's a section on freezing layers in the UI).**

**Step 3: Configure Dataset**

* Select a **built-in dataset** or provide a **custom dataset,** we''ll go with the open-r1/OpenR1-Math-220k dataset for which we added support.
* Click **"Preview Dataset"** to verify.

**Step 4: Set Training Hyperparameters**

| Parameter                 | Recommended Value         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Learning Rate**         | `5e-5`                    |
| **Epochs**                | `3`                       |
| **Batch Size**            | `2` (adjust based on GPU) |
| **Gradient Accumulation** | `4` (for small GPUs)      |
| **Scheduler**             | `cosine`                  |
| **Compute Type**          | `bf16` (for modern GPUs)  |

**Step 5: Start Training**

* Click **Start** to launch fine-tuning.
* Monitor logs and **loss curves** to track progress.

### 3. Chat

After the model finishes training, you can move to the Chat tab and follow the steps below:

* select the model&#x20;
* select the checkpoint you want to test
* write your query in the Input section and submit the query

Here you can try the model out. As you can see below, it has already started showing reasoning:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-02-24 at 18.01.38 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After it finishes, you can expand the **Though** section to see all of the reasoning tokens.

### 4. Evaluating Your Fine‚ÄêTuned/Trained Model

Once your training (or fine‚Äêtuning) has completed, you can **evaluate** the new model from within the Web UI:

1. **Navigate to the ‚ÄúEvaluate & Predict‚Äù Tab**\
   From the top menu in LLaMA Factory (Train / Evaluate & Predict / Chat / Export), click **Evaluate & Predict**.
2. **Select Your Checkpoint**
   * **Model name**: Choose the same base model used for fine‚Äêtuning (e.g., `Llama-3.2-3B` ).
   * **Checkpoint path**: Pick the checkpoint directory you just trained (e.g., `train_2025-02-17-12-36-51`).
3. **Configure the Dataset for Evaluation**
   * **Data dir**: Set to the directory containing your dataset files (e.g., `data`).
   * **Dataset**: Select the dataset entry you want to evaluate on (e.g., `open-r1/OpenR1-Math-220k`).
   * Use the **Preview dataset** button (optional) to confirm that the dataset is recognized properly (e.g., no `'from'` KeyError, or other format issues).
4. **Adjust Evaluation Settings**
   * **Cutoff length**: The maximum token length in your input sequences (e.g., 1024).
   * **Max samples**: How many data samples to evaluate (e.g., 1000).
   * **Batch size**: The number of samples processed simultaneously per GPU (e.g., 2 or 4, depending on GPU memory).
   * **Save predictions**: Tick this box to store the model outputs on each sample.
   * **Maximum new tokens**: How many tokens the model may generate for each example (e.g., 512).
   * **Top‚Äêp** and **Temperature**: Sampling hyperparameters‚Äîadjust for different sampling behaviors (e.g., `top_p=0.7`, `temperature=0.95`).
   * **Output dir**: Where the evaluation logs and predictions will be saved.
5. **Start the Evaluation**
   * Click **Start**.
   * Monitor logs in the console below the Start button.
   * Once finished, LLaMA Factory will show the evaluation progress and any metrics (if the dataset has built‚Äêin metrics).
   * If **Save predictions** was checked, look for a file (e.g., `.jsonl` or `.csv`) in the `output` directory with each sample‚Äôs output.
6. **Review Results**
   * If your dataset or LLaMA Factory supplies metrics (like accuracy, perplexity, or F1), they will appear in the logs or console.
   * You can also open the saved predictions file to see the raw completions on each sample.

> **Tip**: If your dataset does not provide built‚Äêin metrics, you will see only raw predictions. You can parse these to do custom scoring if needed.

Final results will be visible after the evaluation finishes, it's a good practice to evaluate model you're starting off with and then evaluate the fine-tuned/trained one so you can understand if results improved or not.

### 5. Exporting the model&#x20;

For exporting models, you need to switch to the export tab and follow these steps:&#x20;

* Set the export dir (where you want the model to be saved in the mapped volume); you can later download it from this directory; it's recommended to be under one of the mounted volumes in the `.apolo/live.yaml`&#x20;

```yaml
output:
  remote: storage:$[[ flow.project_id ]]/output
  mount: /app/saves
  local: output
```

* you can also provide the HF Hub ID, if you want the model to be uploaded to that Huggingface Repo

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-02-25 at 19.09.52.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After exporting the model on Huggingface, you can deploy it also using the vLLM app

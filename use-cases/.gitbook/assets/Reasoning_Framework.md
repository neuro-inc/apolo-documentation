# How can we use existing reasoning models and where do they fit in the process

Below is a more practical “mapping” from each of the open- or semi-open “o1-like” systems (including OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and so forth) onto the four-service framework—**Policy Initialization**, **Reward Design**, **Search**, and **Learning**—plus some indication of which referenced approaches they’re using or could use. For each model, we’ll point out how it might plug into one or more of these “services” and what references or methods it appears to draw upon or could draw upon.

---

## 1. Policy Initialization

### 1.1 OpenAI-o1

- **Likely Approach**:
    1. **Massive Pre-training** (à la GPT-style).
    2. **Instruction Fine-Tuning** (c.f. Wei et al. 2022a [FLAN], Ouyang et al. 2022 [ChatGPT], etc.).
    3. **Human-like Reasoning Behaviors**: We see traces of problem decomposition, reflection, self-correction, etc.
- **How**:
    - They presumably started with a large base LLM (like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 style) then used supervised fine-tuning on carefully curated data with chain-of-thought.
    - They heavily emphasize *reinforcement learning from human feedback* (RLHF) for alignment.

### 1.2 DeepSeek-R1

- **Likely Approach**:
    1. Also a large pre-trained base.
    2. Possibly “Self-Instruct” or RLHF style to produce chain-of-thought or “deep-seeking” solutions.
- **How**:
    - They could incorporate “Task Decomposition” and “Reflection” behaviors (like Madaan et al. 2023, Self-Refine) directly in the prompt or from instruction-tuned data.
    - Not fully open-sourced, so we only know that they highlight advanced reasoning on math/coding tasks.

### 1.3 Others (Marco-o1, o1-coder, etc.)

- **Marco-o1**:
    - *Base* is usually an open checkpoint (like LLaMA family).
    - They add a small amount of supervised fine-tuning with instruct data + partial solutions from search.
- **o1-coder**:
    - Focuses on code generation, so pre-training is likely code-heavy (like CodeLLaMA or an instruct-tuned coder model).
    - Also includes specialized data for debugging and multi-step code reasoning.

**References**:

- For code or math domain pretraining, see Chen et al. (2021), Fan et al. (2022), etc.
- For instruction tuning: Wei et al. (2022a), Chung et al. (2024), Taori et al. (2023), etc.
- For injecting “human-like reasoning behaviors,” see Bursztyn et al. (2022) for decomposition, Weng et al. (2023) for self-verification, etc.

---

## 2. Reward Design

### 2.1 OpenAI-o1

- **Likely Approach**:
    - A large suite of *preference-based* data (Christiano et al. 2017, Stiennon et al. 2020) for alignment.
    - *Outcome rewards* for tasks with known solutions (like math or coding).
    - *Process-level feedback* for deeper chain-of-thought correctness (Lightman et al. 2024 mentions step-level verifying).
- **How**:
    - They combine RLHF from crowdworkers (preference labeling or deeper textual feedback) plus some environment-based signals (e.g., code execution, math verification).
    - Possibly advanced “reward shaping” (Ng et al. 1999) to turn final correctness into dense signals for intermediate steps.

### 2.2 DeepSeek-R1

- **Likely Approach**:
    - Probably outcome-based or partial step-based verification for coding/math tasks (like Dou et al. 2024 or Chen et al. 2024c).
    - Possibly a *preference model* trained on how “deep” the chain-of-thought is or how “explanatory” it is.
- **How**:
    - If specialized in “deep seeking” problem solving, they might measure solution complexity or thoroughness.
    - Could use standard test-case or symbolic-checker reward signals in code/math domains.

### 2.3 Others

- **o1-journey**: The first part used a *process reward* for partial math solutions. The second part did more distillation from an existing model.
- **Open-Reasoner**: Uses “verifier-based RL,” akin to a reward model that checks correctness.
- **Slow Thinking with LLMs**: Also trains a “verifier” or “process reward” model to evaluate partial steps.

**References**:

- For environment-based (code, math), Dou et al. (2024), Shojaee et al. (2023), Zhang et al. (2024e).
- For preference-based RLHF, Christiano et al. (2017), Bai et al. (2022a), Stiennon et al. (2020).
- For shaping with partial correctness, Lightman et al. (2024), Setlur et al. (2024).

---

## 3. Search

### 3.1 OpenAI-o1

- **Likely Approach**:
    - Large-scale search at *train-time* and more “thinking” at *test-time*.
    - Possibly a “Best-of-N” or partial tree expansion strategy.
    - Evidence from their blog that “longer chain-of-thought” and “trial and error” helps.
- **How**:
    - They might do something akin to MCTS on certain tasks (like code or game-like logic) or simpler large-sample Best-of-N with a reward model.
    - At inference, they do “sequential revision” or “self-correction” in the multi-turn chat style.

### 3.2 DeepSeek-R1

- **Likely Approach**:
    - Emphasizes searching for more complex or deeper solutions. Possibly repeated sampling or partial expansions.
    - Could be a BFS/DFS (Yao et al. 2023a “Tree of Thought”) or ReACT-like (Yao et al. 2023b) approach.
- **How**:
    - They present partial reasoning steps, get environment feedback (like code or math checking), then refine.

### 3.3 Others

- **Open-Reasoner**: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is used to improve final solutions.
- **o1-journey (Part 1)**: Beam search to generate partial solutions, then the best partial solutions are refined by GPT-4.
- **Slow Thinking with LLMs**: MCTS or “iterative self-correcting.”
- **Marco-o1**: MCTS + partial reflection at each step.
- **o1-coder**: MCTS specialized for coding tasks (compilation-based reward).

**References**:

- Best-of-N: Brown et al. (2024), Cobbe et al. (2021).
- MCTS: Silver et al. (2016), Wan et al. (2024), Chen et al. (2024a).
- Sequential Revision: Madaan et al. (2023), Shinn et al. (2023).
- Tree-of-Thought: Yao et al. (2023a).

---

## 4. Learning (Reinforcement or Distillation)

### 4.1 OpenAI-o1

- **Likely Approach**:
    1. **RLHF**: Probably a PPO-based pipeline (Ouyang et al. 2022 style).
    2. Possibly also **DPO** (Rafailov et al. 2023) or a custom actor-critic for chain-of-thought signals.
- **How**:
    - They gather solutions from the policy (with or without search).
    - Label them with a reward model (or direct human ranking).
    - Do repeated RL updates that steadily align policy with higher-reward solutions.

### 4.2 DeepSeek-R1

- **Likely Approach**:
    - Could rely partly on **Behavior Cloning** if they produce high-quality solutions. Possibly combined with preference-based RL.
    - The name suggests heavier usage of RL to push “deep seeking” search strategies.

### 4.3 Others

- **Open-Reasoner**: PPO or a variant during training, plus MCTS data for partial solutions.
- **Slow Thinking with LLMs**: They do DPO or SFT on solutions produced by MCTS (two technical reports).
- **o1-journey (Part 1)**: “Expert iteration” style—beam search → refine with GPT-4 → SFT.
- **o1-journey (Part 2)**: Distilling hidden chain-of-thought from a strong but “private” teacher (like Qwen-72B or o1-mini).
- **Marco-o1**: MCTS → SFT. Possibly introduces partial reflection to produce more curated data.
- **o1-coder**: MCTS for code, then supervised fine-tuning.

**References**:

- PPO: Schulman et al. (2017), Ouyang et al. (2022).
- DPO: Rafailov et al. (2023), Xie et al. (2024).
- Behavior Cloning & Expert Iteration: Silver et al. (2017) (AlphaGo Zero), Zelikman et al. (2022) (STaR), Touvron et al. (2023) (LLaMA 2).

## Putting It All Together

1. **OpenAI-o1**
    - **Policy Init**: Big LLM pretraining + instruction finetuning + unlocking reflection behaviors.
    - **Reward Design**: Large preference data (RLHF) + environment checks for tasks.
    - **Search**: Possibly sampling-based or partial tree expansions to generate high-quality data.
    - **Learning**: PPO or a similar RL approach from that data.
2. **DeepSeek-R1**
    - **Policy Init**: Possibly also big pretraining + instruction tuning.
    - **Reward Design**: For deep solutions, they might rely on environment (math/coding) or a custom “depth” measure.
    - **Search**: Emphasizes iterative expansions, possibly BFS or MCTS with feedback.
    - **Learning**: Some combination of BC on “deep solutions” plus RL to push exploration.
3. **Others** (like o1-journey, Open-Reasoner, Slow Thinking with LLMs)
    - They mix and match:
        - *Train-time search* (Beam or MCTS), or *test-time search* (self-correction, BFS).
        - *Reward modeling* (verifier or preference).
        - *Learning* via BC (expert iteration) or RL (PPO, DPO).

Thus, each “service” in your framework—Policy Initialization, Reward Design, Search, and Learning—can be “activated” by the relevant references or approaches these projects used. Different combinations yield the various “o1-like” pipelines we see.

# Multi-Phased Execution Plan (Reasoning Framework)

Below is a proposed multi-phased, iterative roadmap to build and validate a “reasoning framework” along the lines of the blueprint we’ve been discussing. Each phase has tangible deliverables, and each step unlocks further functionality for training and deploying reasoner models. The plan assumes you start with a certain baseline LLM (or multiple LLMs you want to experiment with).

---

## **Phase 0: Foundations and Setup**

1. **Infrastructure & Environment Setup**
    - **Deliverable**: A minimal pipeline that can host your chosen model (e.g., LLaMA, Falcon, or GPT-style) and run text-in/text-out.
    - **Tasks**:
        - Configure GPU/accelerator environment.
        - Wrap model in a standard API (e.g., “generate tokens,” “get log probabilities”) so you can do more advanced operations later.
2. **Dataset Ingestion & Management**
    - **Deliverable**: A data pipeline for reading/writing multiple dataset formats (math, code, instruction data, etc.).
    - **Tasks**:
        - Download relevant open datasets (e.g., MATH, GSM8K, FLAN, code sets).
        - Create a uniform structure: e.g., JSON lines with `{"prompt": "...", "solution": "...", "reward": X}` or similar.

**Why do this first?**

Because every service—Policy Init, Reward, Search, Learning—depends on a functioning environment and consistent dataset handling.

---

## **Phase 1: Policy Initialization**

**Objective**: Produce a “strong enough” base policy capable of multi-step reasoning behaviors like “think aloud,” “reflect,” or “decompose tasks,” at least in a basic sense.

1. **Instruction Fine-Tuning**
    - **Deliverable**: A single-turn instruction-tuned checkpoint.
    - **Tasks**:
        - Fine-tune your base LLM on open instruction data (e.g., FLAN, Super-NaturalInstructions, Alpaca, etc.).
        - Validate that it can follow basic instructions or short tasks.
2. **Chain-of-Thought / Reasoning Behaviors**
    - **Deliverable**: A refined checkpoint that can produce step-by-step solutions or “reflect” in some manner.
    - **Tasks**:
        - Option 1: **Supervised Fine-Tuning** on chain-of-thought style data (like “explanations” from MATH, GSM8K).
        - Option 2: **Prompt Engineering** to see if the model already supports “self-check,” “analyze,” or “decompose.”
    - **Verification**: Evaluate on small math or logic tasks. Confirm that the model can produce a multi-step reasoning output.
3. **Intermediate Checkpoint**
    - **Deliverable**: “InitPolicy-v1” – a single standard checkpoint that we’ll use for the next phases.

**Why do this now?**

We want a workable initial policy before advanced RL or search. If it can’t even produce coherent multi-step text, it’s tough to do more.

---

## **Phase 2: Basic Search Module**

**Objective**: Implement a *search wrapper* that can sample multiple solutions or step expansions, orchestrating calls to the model’s text generation.

1. **Best-of-N (BoN) Search**
    - **Deliverable**: A small library that, given a prompt, samples N solutions from the policy, and uses *some* scoring method (e.g., perplexity or a naive “verifier”) to pick the best.
    - **Verification**: Compare “BoN pass@1” vs. “single-sample pass@1” on, e.g., math tasks. Show improvement.
2. **Beam Search**
    - **Deliverable**: A beam-search-based decoding that prunes or expands partial sequences.
    - **Tasks**:
        - Add hyperparameters: beam size, length penalty, etc.
        - Possibly allow a small user-provided function (e.g., partial step checking) to prune.
3. **Sequential Revision / Self-Refine** (Optional but Powerful)
    - **Deliverable**: A function that takes an initial model output, asks the model to critique or evaluate it, then produces a revised version—repeatedly.
    - **Verification**: Show improvement from “Refine x times” on a set of test prompts.

**End Result**:

You have an off-the-shelf “search service” that can be toggled between BoN, beam, or refinement. Even without advanced reward modeling, you can rely on naive heuristics or partial ground-truth checks to pick the best solution.

---

## **Phase 3: Reward Design & Integration**

**Objective**: Provide dense or outcome-based signals for tasks, so that the search and subsequent RL phases can rely on *real* reward feedback.

1. **Outcome-Based Reward**
    - **Deliverable**: A function that checks final solutions for correctness. Examples:
        - **Math**: Compare the final numeric answer to ground truth (MATH, GSM8K).
        - **Code**: Run the code snippet or test cases, check pass/fail.
    - **Verification**: *Search Integration* – let your search wrapper call this function automatically to pick or prune solutions.
2. **Process Reward** / Step-by-Step Labeling (Optional but recommended)
    - **Deliverable**: A custom “verifier” or “scoring model” that can examine partial reasoning steps.
    - **Tasks**:
        - Possibly train a step-level classifier on step-labeled data (Lightman et al. 2024) or hand-labeled partial math solutions.
        - Provide a numeric reward (e.g., +1 if a step is correct, 0 otherwise) to guide the search or RL more granularly.
3. **Preference-Based Reward (RLHF)**
    - **Deliverable**: A small “reward model” (RM) trained on preference-labeled outputs.
    - **Tasks**:
        - Collect (or re-use) pairs/triples of model outputs, each with a human or proxy ranking.
        - Train a Bradley-Terry or direct preference model.
    - **Verification**: *Check correlation with known correctness*. E.g., does the RM give highest scores to correct solutions?

At the end of Phase 3, we have a “Reward Service” that can plug into the search from Phase 2 (or future RL).

---

## **Phase 4: Advanced Search & Generation of Training Data**

**Objective**: Combine the “Search” from Phase 2 with the “Reward” from Phase 3 to systematically collect higher-quality data. This data is critical for the Learning (RL) step.

1. **Data Generation Runs**
    - **Deliverable**: A “search pipeline” that, for each problem in your dataset(s), runs e.g. MCTS or Best-of-N or self-refinement, obtains the highest-reward solution, and logs:
        - (prompt, partial steps, final solution, reward).
    - **Verification**: Confirm that the search pipeline is stable and can handle, say, 1k or 10k tasks.
2. **Scaling**
    - **Deliverable**: Rerun the above pipeline on larger sets (like MATH, code challenges, etc.) to produce enough examples of “search-improved solutions.”
    - **Why**: This data will be used to fine-tune or RL-train your model.

At this point, you have a method to produce new examples that are (on average) better than naive single-sample solutions. You also have the associated reward. This sets the stage for RL-based improvement.

---

## **Phase 5: Learning / RL or Distillation**

**Objective**: Actually *improve* the policy, using the search-generated data or environment interactions.

1. **Behavior Cloning (BC)**
    - **Deliverable**: A “BC pipeline” that takes the top solutions (highest reward) from Phase 4’s data and re-trains the policy to mimic them.
    - **Verification**: Evaluate the new policy’s pass@1 vs. the old policy. Show improvement.
2. **Policy Gradient (PPO, DPO, etc.)**
    - **Deliverable**: Optionally train the model with a policy gradient method on *all* solutions (including negative or partial).
    - **Tasks**:
        - Implement or adapt an open-source RLHF codebase (e.g., Hugging Face’s TRL) but hooking it up to your reward function.
        - Possibly do multiple epochs of RL, sampling new data from updated policy each time (online or “semi-online” approach).
    - **Verification**: Evaluate success metrics (math accuracy, code pass rate, or subjective preference).
3. **Iterate**
    - Possibly cycle back to Phase 4 with your improved policy, re-run search to gather even better data, and re-train. This is akin to AlphaGo Zero’s iterative “expert iteration.”

---

## **Phase 6: Test-Time Search & Packaging**

**Objective**: Expose the final “reasoning framework” to end users or downstream tasks in a flexible, robust way.

1. **Inference-Time Search**
    - Decide how you want to “package” search at inference:
        - Quick “Best-of-N sampling”?
        - Full-blown MCTS if you want maximum performance (but more compute)?
        - Self-refine loops with your final policy?
    - **Deliverable**: A “Reasoner API” that can be called with a user query and automatically runs whichever approach you pick.
2. **User-Facing API**
    - **Deliverable**: Possibly a REST or gRPC endpoint that orchestrates:
        1. The *final policy inference*.
        2. Optionally *search expansions* or *refinement steps*.
        3. Returning the best solution.
    - **Verification**: Beta test with real user queries.
3. **Logging & Monitoring**
    - Collect logs for user satisfaction or further training data.

---

## **Phase 7: Extensions & Refinements (Ongoing)**

**Objective**: Improve domain coverage, incorporate new tasks, or unify with multi-modality or real environment interaction.

1. **Domain-Specific Enhancements**
    - If you want to handle more complex tasks (e.g. specialized code generation in, say, Rust or a complicated math domain), you can re-run earlier phases with domain corpora.
2. **Multi-modal** (Optional)
    - Expand your “search” or “reward” logic to handle images or external tools (Hao et al. 2023 “Reasoning with LLM is Planning with World Model,” etc.).
3. **Iterate**
    - This entire plan can run in a loop. Each time you have more data or improved models, the search and learning can yield better performance.

---

## **Summary of Deliverables and Verification**

1. **Phase 0**: Working environment, consistent dataset pipeline.
2. **Phase 1**: Baseline “InitPolicy-v1” with instruction tuning + basic step-by-step reasoning.
3. **Phase 2**: Search module (BoN, beam, or sequential refine).
4. **Phase 3**: Reward design (outcome checks, preference model, optional step-level).
5. **Phase 4**: Automated data generation using Phase 2 + 3, storing (prompt, solution, reward).
6. **Phase 5**: Policy learning from that data (Behavior Cloning, PPO, etc.).
7. **Phase 6**: Production-grade reasoning API with optional search at inference.
8. **Phase 7**: Domain expansions, iteration, or multi-modality.

At each phase, you have a discrete deliverable (“We have a stable instruction model,” “We have a working search library,” “We have a reward function with known accuracy,” “We improved pass@1 from X to Y,” etc.), making each step verifiable and trackable. By phasing it out in this manner, you ensure incremental progress and can pivot or refine your approach based on real-world performance data.

# Paper to domain mapping

Below is a grouped collection of references, organized by the four major “services” (or components) of the reasoning framework outlined in the paper: **(1) Policy Initialization**, **(2) Reward Design**, **(3) Search**, and **(4) Learning**. Under each heading, you’ll see papers that the paper itself references as crucial background or exemplars. These references can serve as a starting point to implement each respective “service” in your modular reasoner system.

### How to Use These Groupings

- **Policy Initialization** references are invaluable for building or refining the *base model* (pretraining, instruction tuning, and injecting step-by-step or “human-like” reasoning).
- **Reward Design** references show how to create outcome or process rewards, handle preference learning, do inverse RL, or tackle shaping and distribution-shift concerns.
- **Search** references provide blueprint algorithms (Best-of-N, beam search, MCTS, sequential revision) and expansions for bridging “thinking more” at inference or train-time data collection.
- **Learning** references cover the main RL algorithms (PPO, DPO, etc.) and behavior cloning approaches to incorporate the newly generated data/trajectories into the policy’s weights.

Taken together, these papers give a rich literature basis for *each service* you’d want to implement in a modular reasoner framework.

# Reasoning Datasets

Below is a grouping of **open reasoning datasets** mentioned or implied in the paper (or its references), along with suggestions on *where* in the four-service pipeline they typically fit. Some datasets can be relevant to more than one stage—e.g., a math dataset might help with both supervised instruction tuning and RL-based fine-tuning. But this categorization shows their *most common uses* in a reasoning-focused workflow.

---

## 1. Policy Initialization Datasets

These are datasets people often use to **pre-train** or **instruction-tune** models, giving them a general “reasoning” or “instruction-following” capability right off the bat.

1. **FLAN Instruction Data (Wei et al. 2022a)**
    - *What it is*: A broad collection of tasks cast as instructions (“finetuned language models are zero-shot learners”).
    - *Open?*: Yes, FLAN is publicly available.
    - *Where it fits*:
        - **Instruction Fine-Tuning** for policy initialization, so the model learns to follow and solve multiple instruction types.
2. **Super-NaturalInstructions (Wang et al. 2022b)**
    - *What it is*: A large suite (1,600+ tasks) framed as instructions.
    - *Open?*: Yes, publicly released.
    - *Where it fits*:
        - **Instruction Fine-Tuning** to expand the model’s coverage of tasks and reasoning formats.
3. **Self-Instruct (Wang et al. 2023b)**
    - *What it is*: A method/dataset where an LLM itself generates new tasks and solutions to increase instruction diversity.
    - *Open?*: Yes, the pipeline and examples are open-sourced.
    - *Where it fits*:
        - **Instruction Fine-Tuning** for a broader variety of user queries and step-by-step instructions.
4. **Alpaca (Taori et al. 2023)**
    - *What it is*: 52K instruction–response pairs generated from GPT and used to fine-tune smaller LLMs.
    - *Open?*: Yes (the dataset is on GitHub, though the underlying GPT calls are subject to original disclaimers).
    - *Where it fits*:
        - **Instruction Fine-Tuning** (policy init), often with short to moderately complex instructions.
5. **Code or Math Pretraining Corpora**
    - E.g., [Code-based corpora](https://github.com/openai/human-eval) for code LLMs; [Math texts or “ArXiv math” data] used in some projects.
    - *Open?*: Many large code repositories are partially open, and math text corpora (arXiv, StackExchange dumps) exist.
    - *Where it fits*:
        - **Pre-Training** or specialized domain training (e.g., code or math) so that the model is well-initialized for advanced reasoning in code or symbolic math.

---

## 2. Reward Design Datasets

Datasets that help train a *reward model* or *verifier*, or provide ground-truth signals for outcome-based reward. Many are “annotated for correctness” or “paired preference data,” so they’re used in **Reward Modeling**.

1. **Preference Data (Human Rankings)**
    - *Generic RLHF Setup*: Collect pairs or sets of answers, each with a human ranking.
    - *Open?*: Partially; some RLHF datasets exist but are not always fully released. OpenAssistant, Anthropic HH data, etc., have partial releases.
    - *Where it fits*:
        - **Reward Modeling** from preference data for alignment (Christiano et al. 2017, Stiennon et al. 2020).
2. **MATH (Cobbe et al. 2021)**
    - *What it is*: A dataset with 12K competition-level math problems; each has a “ground-truth” solution.
    - *Open?*: Yes (GitHub: “openai/MATH”).
    - *Where it fits*:
        - **Outcome Reward** for math correctness (0/1) if the final answer matches the reference.
        - Can also be used to train a *verifier model* that checks partial solutions for correctness (Lightman et al. 2024).
3. **GSM8K**
    - *Not explicitly named in the paper’s references but heavily used in the LLM community.*
    - *What it is*: ~8K grade-school math problems with solutions.
    - *Open?*: Yes.
    - *Where it fits*:
        - Same function as MATH: *Outcome-based reward* or *verifier training*.
4. **ALFWorld / AlfWorld Data (Shridhar et al. 2021)**
    - *What it is*: An environment+dataset bridging text instructions and environment states.
    - *Open?*: Yes, on GitHub.
    - *Where it fits*:
        - **Environment-based Reward**: Use logs from ALFWorld or the environment itself to train a reward model that says “success/fail” for certain actions.
5. **MineDojo (Fan et al. 2022)**
    - *What it is*: A simulation environment + tasks for open-ended Minecraft-based reasoning.
    - *Open?*: Yes, publicly available.
    - *Where it fits*:
        - **Reward Design**: Environment returns success signals (did you build X?), so you can train or shape a reward model to replicate environment feedback.

---

## 3. Search Datasets

Here we mean “datasets or tasks commonly used to **evaluate** or **drive** search-based strategies (like MCTS, Best-of-N, or BFS).” Often, they are test sets with known solutions, letting you test if search can find them.

1. **MATH (Cobbe et al. 2021)** again
    - Because MATH problems have known solutions, they’re used to test multi-step search.
    - *Where it fits*:
        - **Search**: The model can do MCTS or BFS, then compare to ground truth.
2. **Code Challenges (e.g., HumanEval, MBPP, APPS)**
    - *HumanEval* (Chen et al. 2021): 164 coding tasks with ground truth.
    - *MBPP* (Austin et al. 2021): ~1k code problems.
    - *APPS* (Hendrycks et al. 2021): ~10k programming challenges.
    - *Open?*: Yes, widely used, with public GitHubs.
    - *Where it fits*:
        - **Search**: Evaluate whether multi-sample or MCTS-based code generation hits correct solutions (pass@N metric).
3. **“Step-checking” or “Process Supervision”**
    - Datasets that contain partial solutions with correctness tags (Lightman et al. 2024). Not all are fully open, but some math subsets or hand-labeled step data exist.
    - *Where it fits*:
        - **Search**: You can incorporate partial-check feedback to prune search branches.

---

## 4. Learning (Reinforcement / Distillation) Datasets

Some open sets are used specifically to **train** or **finetune** an LLM in a reinforcement loop or an expert-distillation loop (e.g., “Expert Iteration” style).

1. **MATH** or **GSM8K** (again)
    - Because you have ground truth or partial step correctness, you can do *Behavior Cloning from correct solutions* or *PPO w.r.t. final correctness.*
    - *Where it fits*:
        - **Learning** (RL or supervised) from environment-labeled correctness.
2. **Self-Refine Data** (Madaan et al. 2023)
    - The “SELF-REFINE” approach can produce a dataset of “(initial draft → self-feedback → refined draft).”
    - *Open?*: The approach is open-sourced, though the final curated data might vary.
    - *Where it fits*:
        - **Behavior Cloning** from refined solutions or partial preference data for RL.
3. **STaR (Zelikman et al. 2022)**
    - *What it is*: A process of generating solutions and automatically filtering correct ones to build a curated fine-tuning set.
    - *Open?*: The methodology is described; actual code and instructions are partially open.
    - *Where it fits*:
        - **Learning**: Expert iteration or iterative BC. The dataset is effectively “LLM’s correct self-solutions.”
4. **Open-Source RLHF Datasets**
    - Projects like **OpenAssistant** or **LAION** have partially open preference data.
    - *Where it fits*:
        - **Learning**: Pair it with PPO, DPO, or other RL on top of your policy.

---

## Summary: Where These Datasets “Slot In”

- **Policy Initialization**
    - *Instruction-based data* (FLAN, Super-NaturalInstructions, Self-Instruct, Alpaca)
    - *Domain pretraining corpora* for math or code.
- **Reward Design**
    - *Human preference sets* (OpenAssistant, Anthropic HH, etc.)
    - *Environment-labeled sets* (ALFWorld, MineDojo) or code testers.
    - *Math or code correctness sets* (MATH, GSM8K) to build a “verifier.”
- **Search**
    - *Evaluation sets* that have a strong notion of correctness (MATH, code tasks like HumanEval, MBPP, APPS).
    - *Partial step-labeled data* if you do process-level expansions.
- **Learning (RL or BC)**
    - *Ground-truth reasoning tasks* (again MATH, GSM8K, code sets) for supervised or RL
    - *Self-generated correctness data* (Self-Refine, STaR)
    - *Open RLHF sets* for policy gradient or preference-based optimization.

Essentially, these open datasets (especially MATH, GSM8K, code sets, and large instruction collections) can serve double or triple roles. They might help with instruction finetuning (policy init), with building a reward model (if they have correctness or preference annotations), with search-based expansions (since you know the final ground-truth answers), and with final RL or BC.

Hence, the same dataset is often reused across multiple steps in the pipeline—what changes is *how* you use it (supervised fine-tuning vs. training a reward model vs. verifying search outputs, etc.).

# Reasoning Framework Viability

It’s to build a system that any organization (or individual) can “plug” a model into and get a reasoner-style LLM out of it. The key is designing each of the four components (policy initialization, reward design, search, and learning) in a *model-agnostic* way. Below are a few considerations that make it possible:

---

### 1. Model-Agnostic Interfaces

1. **Policy API**
    - To slot in *any* base LLM, you just need a uniform way to (a) provide prompts/contexts, (b) receive token-level or chunk-level outputs, and (c) possibly reset or backtrack for search.
    - This is typically easy if the model is accessible through a standard text completion or chat API.
2. **Reward API**
    - The system’s reward “service” shouldn’t assume anything special about *how* the model generates text, only that it can provide final or partial outputs.
    - For example, for math or code tasks, the reward service just runs the code or checks the solution. For alignment tasks, it runs a preference or compliance check.
    - That means you can plug in a Hugging Face model, an API-based model, or an in-house checkpoint—whatever can yield text.
3. **Search API**
    - The search logic (e.g., beam search, MCTS, self-reflection loops) can remain “one level above” the model, simply orchestrating calls to the model.
    - The search algorithm only needs the ability to “ask” the model for the next token/step/solution, then evaluate it.
4. **Learning/Fine-Tuning API**
    - If you have local access to weights (like open-source LLaMA/CodeLLaMA or Falcon), you can do RL or supervised fine-tuning.
    - If the model is closed-source and API-only, you could still do *some* “reward re-ranking” or “search-based distillation” externally, but you’re limited in how you actually retrain or update the base model.
    - The more control you have over the model’s parameters, the more you can do deep RL.

---

### 2. Uniform “Blueprint” with Swappable Modules

Given these interfaces, you can design a single “blueprint”:

1. **Initialization**:
    - Let the user specify how they want to build their base model or pass in an existing checkpoint.
    - Optionally allow them to do a small amount of supervised instruction tuning right in your pipeline.
2. **Reward Specification**:
    - A simple set of hooks for registering “how do I evaluate a candidate solution?” for different tasks.
    - Could be an environment-based function (execute code) or an LLM-based preference checker.
3. **Search**:
    - The user can choose from a drop-down: “Best-of-N sampling,” “beam search,” “MCTS,” “self-refine,” etc.
    - Provide step-by-step logs of the partial solutions and final picks.
4. **Learning**:
    - Let the user pick “Behavior Cloning,” “PPO,” or “DPO” if they’re training the model weights, or skip if the user only has black-box model access.
    - Possibly share or store the generated data so it can be leveraged for future finetuning.

If each of these steps is implemented behind uniform, well-defined APIs, *any model* that can handle “predict next token” calls (or “generate text from a prompt”) can fit into your reasoner system.

---

### 3. Challenges and Caveats

1. **Closed-Source vs. Open-Source**
    - If the model is fully open (like many open-source LLMs), you can integrate *all* the RL pieces (PPO, DPO, etc.).
    - If the model is only accessible through an API, your *learning* options may be limited to *reward re-ranking* or *search strategies*; true finetuning might not be possible.
2. **Efficiency**
    - Techniques like MCTS and repeated self-refinement can be expensive. Some large models will be slow for big iterative searches, so you might want to provide user-configurable trade-offs (e.g., limit expansions, prune aggressively).
3. **Data Governance**
    - Users might not want to share their own domain data (especially for code or proprietary math tasks). So each portion of the pipeline should handle data privacy carefully.

---

### Bottom Line

Yes, it’s *definitely* possible to build a “reasoner framework” that any user can attach an LLM to in order to get advanced inference (search) and iterative improvement (RL) capabilities. By carefully designing each piece (policy init, reward, search, and learning) to be model-agnostic, you enable maximum flexibility.

In other words, it really can be a universal blueprint:

> Plug in your base model → define your reward → pick your search method → (optionally) do RL → deploy.
> 

This modular approach is precisely why you can imagine a “Reasoner as a Service,” where new models can be dropped in, get stronger reasoning, and self-improve over time

File: /sub-pages/Service Breakdown.md

# Service Breakdown

Below is a concise “service breakdown,” describing how each major component (or “service”) in the Reasoner Framework will specialize in a distinct aspect of building advanced reasoning capabilities. Together, they enable a modular plug-and-play system for transforming any LLM into a powerful reasoner.

---

## **1. Policy Initialization Service**

**Specialization:**

- *Starting point for a coherent, human-like reasoning policy.*
- *Equips* a baseline LLM with the fundamental ability to follow instructions, reason step by step, self-reflect, and check correctness at least at a basic level.

**Key Responsibilities:**

1. **Instruction Fine-Tuning**
    - Applies large, open instruction datasets (FLAN, Alpaca, etc.) to teach the model to follow user prompts and produce structured, helpful answers.
2. **Chain-of-Thought or Reasoning Behaviors**
    - Optionally refines the model on curated chain-of-thought data or uses prompt-based methods to activate reflection, decomposition, or self-check behaviors.
3. **Domain Specialization** (Optional)
    - If needed, fine-tunes or pre-trains on domain-specific corpora (code, math, medical data) so that the LLM is proficient in the tasks that follow.

**Deliverables:**

- A strong “initial policy” model (Checkpoint + Inference API) that can be used in subsequent reward, search, or RL pipelines.

---

## **2. Reward Design Service**

**Specialization:**

- *Generates or provides reward signals*—numerical or preference-based—to guide the model toward correct or aligned behavior.

**Key Responsibilities:**

1. **Outcome Reward**
    - Determines correctness purely from the *final* model output. Examples include code execution results or checking math solutions against known answers.
2. **Process Reward**
    - Scores *intermediate steps* (e.g., verifying partial solutions in math, code, or multi-turn problem-solving) to offer denser feedback.
3. **Preference-Based Reward (RLHF)**
    - Creates a “preference model” that ranks multiple solutions to the same query.
    - May be trained from human-labeled preference data or from a previously established “best-of-N” approach.
4. **Heuristics & World Knowledge** (Optional)
    - For specialized tasks, can incorporate domain heuristics (like style guidelines, factual checks, or safety constraints).

**Deliverables:**

- A “Reward API” callable by the Search or Learning services to (1) evaluate final solutions, or (2) provide partial feedback (step-level or preference-based).

---

## **3. Search / Inference Wrapper**

**Specialization:**

- *Scales up “thinking”* at inference or training time by generating multiple solutions or refining a single solution iteratively.

**Key Responsibilities:**

1. **Best-of-N (BoN) Sampling**
    - Independently samples multiple candidate answers, queries the Reward Design service to pick the best.
2. **Beam Search / Tree Search**
    - Systematically expands partial solutions, pruning suboptimal branches. May combine with a “value model” or other heuristics from Reward service.
3. **Sequential Revision (“Self-Refine”)**
    - Takes an initial draft from the LLM, runs a self-evaluation or environment check, and asks the LLM to revise. Repeats until a stopping criterion is met.
4. **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)** (Optional)
    - More advanced searching that can look ahead multiple steps using rollouts or partial expansions. Often used for math or code tasks where correctness is robustly checkable.

**Deliverables:**

- A “Search Service” that can orchestrate multi-pass generation and final selection, returning the best or a set of candidate solutions for further training.

---

## **4. Learning / Reinforcement Service**

**Specialization:**

- *Updates or fine-tunes the underlying LLM* using data produced by the Search and Reward services, aiming to improve the policy automatically.

**Key Responsibilities:**

1. **Behavior Cloning**
    - Filters out the top (highest-reward) solutions from Search, then performs supervised fine-tuning on these “expert demonstrations.”
2. **Policy Gradient (PPO, DPO, etc.)**
    - Learns from *all* candidate solutions, weighting them by reward, thus more effectively utilizing negative examples.
3. **Iterative Improvement** (AlphaGo-like)
    - Continuously alternates between (a) generating new data from the updated policy using the Search service, (b) evaluating it with the Reward service, and (c) updating the policy again.
4. **Reference Model and Baselines** (Optional)
    - Maintains reference or baseline models for stability, if needed (as in PPO’s “reference policy”).

**Deliverables:**

- An updated policy model that outperforms its earlier version by matching or exceeding the best solutions discovered via search and guided by reward signals.

---

## **Putting It All Together**

Each service exposes a clear interface:

1. **Policy Initialization** provides the base model (“Init Policy”).
2. **Reward Design** evaluates solutions or partial steps, returning numeric or preference-based scores.
3. **Search** runs extended inference (like Best-of-N, beam, MCTS, or iterative refinement) to generate high-reward solutions or to decide on a final best solution.
4. **Learning** consumes the data from Search+Reward, improving the policy’s parameters so that fewer or simpler search steps might be needed over time, or so that the model’s raw pass@1 accuracy increases.

By cleanly separating responsibilities, you can replace or upgrade each service (e.g., swap out beam search for MCTS, or add a better preference model) without breaking the rest of the system. This modular design directly follows the insights of the “Scaling of Search and Learning: A Roadmap to Reproduce o1 from Reinforcement Learning Perspective,” enabling robust, iterative improvement for any LLM plugged into the framework.

# Reasoning Framework: Building an Open, Modular System for Advanced LLM Reasoning

### **Inspiration**

This project draws on the “Scaling of Search and Learning: A Roadmap to Reproduce o1 from Reinforcement Learning Perspective,” - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14135  which lays out a blueprint for creating powerful reasoning models by combining four components:

1. **Policy Initialization**
2. **Reward Design**
3. **Search**
4. **Learning**

By following these concepts, we aim to create a flexible, service-based “Reasoner Framework,” into which *any* large language model (LLM) can be plugged, gaining enhanced reasoning, better alignment, and iterative self-improvement capabilities.

---

### **Motivation and Goals**

Modern LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1, etc.) exhibit advanced reasoning strategies like self-reflection, task decomposition, alternative solution proposals, and outcome verification. However, reproducing these capabilities in an open-source setting or for custom models remains challenging.

This project’s goal is to:

- **Enable** any baseline LLM to be turned into a “reasoning specialist.”
- **Modularize** each step (policy init, reward, search, learning) so they can be mixed, matched, and improved separately.
- **Scale** both train-time and inference-time “thinking” (search) to solve difficult tasks (math, coding, reasoning, alignment).
- **Deliver** a user-facing system in which organizations can upload or attach their models, pick a reward method, pick a search algorithm, and watch the model’s performance improve iteratively.

---

### **Project Scope and Components**

1. **Policy Initialization Service**
    - Provide an initial LLM (or let the user supply one) with baseline reasoning abilities—potentially combining:
        - **Pre-training** or *domain pre-training* (e.g., code or math corpora).
        - **Instruction Fine-tuning** on open instruction sets (e.g., FLAN, Alpaca) plus chain-of-thought.
        - **Supervised “Reasoning Behavior” Fine-tuning**, so the model can do problem analysis, step-by-step decomposition, self-evaluation, and error correction.
2. **Reward Design Service**
    - Supply dense or outcome-based rewards for a variety of tasks. For instance:
        - **Outcome Reward**: code execution or final numeric correctness for math problems.
        - **Process Reward**: verifying intermediate steps or partial correctness.
        - **Preference-based Reward**: from human annotations (RLHF) or automated preference ranking.
    - This service can be swapped or upgraded per domain (e.g., a code environment vs. math-checking vs. story writing).
3. **Search/Inference Wrapper**
    - A “meta” agent that orchestrates multiple calls to the LLM, generating solution candidates and refining them.
    - Supports:
        - **Best-of-N sampling** or **Beam Search** (with or without partial checks).
        - **MCTS** or other tree search techniques for large, complex tasks.
        - **Sequential revision** / “Self-Refine” loops that let the LLM correct itself iteratively.
    - This can run at *train-time* to gather high-quality data, or at *test-time* to produce better final answers.
4. **Learning/RL Service**
    - Consumes data from the Search step and the Reward service, then updates the LLM policy.
    - Allows either:
        - **Behavior Cloning** (supervised fine-tuning on high-reward solutions).
        - **Policy Gradient** (e.g., PPO or DPO) using both positive and negative solutions.
    - Over time, the model’s policy distribution aligns more closely with high-reward actions.

---

### **Planned Outcomes**

- **Reasoner API**
    
    An integrated pipeline where the user can:
    
    1. **Plug in a model**
    2. **Configure a reward** (or choose from existing ones)
    3. **Select a search strategy** (Best-of-N, MCTS, or iterative revision)
    4. **Optional RL fine-tuning**
    5. Obtain a “reasoning-augmented” LLM that can solve more complex tasks and keep improving via the same framework.
- **Evaluation Benchmarks**
    - Public math sets (e.g., MATH, GSM8K)
    - Code tasks (HumanEval, MBPP, etc.)
    - Possibly alignment tasks (preference-based)These will show how search + RL can systematically boost correctness and reasoning depth.
- **Iterative Improvement**
    
    Because each service is modular, new techniques (like a better process-reward, or a more efficient MCTS) can be dropped in without breaking the rest of the system.

### **Conclusion**

By implementing a reasoner framework inspired by the “Scaling of Search and Learning: A Roadmap to Reproduce o1…” paper, we aim to democratize advanced reasoning capabilities for LLMs. The end result is a robust, open framework that unifies the four cornerstones—Policy Initialization, Reward Design, Search, and Learning—offering any baseline model a path to become an expert-level reasoner with iterative self-improvement.
